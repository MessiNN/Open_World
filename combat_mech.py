"""
Combat Mechanics Module Entry Point

This file imports the core components of the combat system (constants, base enemy,
specific enemy types, and the combat manager) to make them easily accessible
for other parts of the application, such as the world structure or game state handler.

Example Usage (in another file like world_struct_stable.py):

import combat_mech_stable as combat

# Assuming animations are loaded elsewhere into 'all_enemy_animations' dictionary
# Assuming world_data, quadtree, point_in_poly_func are available

combat_handler = combat.CombatManager(world_data, quadtree, point_in_poly_func, all_enemy_animations)

# Spawning enemies
combat_handler.spawn_enemies_in_overworld(10)

# In the main game loop update:
combat_handler.update(player_object, dt, current_game_state)

# If player attack hits (determined by player state machine):
combat_handler.handle_player_attack(player_object)

# In the main game loop draw:
combat_handler.draw(screen_surface, camera.apply_point)
